# Financial-Analysis-Portfolio
Corporate finance portfolio demonstrating capital budgeting (NPV/IRR), DCF valuation, financial statement analysis, and 3-statement financial forecasting models built using real company financial data.
# Finance & Financial Modeling Portfolio

This repository presents a collection of financial analysis and financial modeling projects developed to demonstrate practical application of corporate finance, valuation, and capital market concepts.

The projects simulate real-world tasks performed by corporate finance analysts, FP&A teams, equity research analysts, and investment banking professionals.

The objective of this portfolio is to apply financial theory to decision-making situations including investment appraisal, valuation, financial forecasting, and merger analysis.

## Project 1 — Capital Budgeting Investment Decision
A 5-year financial model evaluating whether a company should launch a new FMCG product line. The model forecasts operating cash flows, incorporates working capital requirements, and evaluates the investment using Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

**Key Concepts:**  
Capital budgeting, free cash flow, time value of money, project evaluation.
### Investment Conclusion

A 5-year discounted cash flow model was constructed to evaluate the launch of a new FMCG product line. The analysis incorporated operating margins, taxation, capital expenditure, and working capital requirements to estimate free cash flows.

The project produced a negative Net Present Value (NPV) and an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) below the company’s cost of capital, indicating that the investment would destroy shareholder value. High fixed operating costs and significant working capital requirements were the primary drivers of the negative valuation.

Sensitivity analysis showed that project viability is highly dependent on pricing and sales volume assumptions. The investment only becomes feasible if the selling price increases materially or production costs are reduced.

Recommendation: Reject the investment in its current form.

## Project 2 — Financial Statement Analysis (ITC Ltd)
A historical financial analysis of ITC Ltd using ratio analysis and DuPont decomposition to assess profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and leverage. The project evaluates operational performance and drivers of return on equity.

**Key Concepts:**  
Ratio analysis, ROE decomposition, working capital efficiency, financial health assessment.
### Financial Performance Interpretation

A five-year financial statement analysis of ITC Ltd was conducted using profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and leverage ratios along with DuPont decomposition.

The company demonstrated stable operating margins and strong return on equity driven primarily by high profitability rather than financial leverage. Working capital efficiency improved over time, particularly through effective management of receivables and inventory.

The DuPont analysis indicated that ROE performance was supported by consistent operating margins and steady asset turnover, suggesting sustainable operating performance rather than dependence on debt financing.

Overall, the company exhibits strong financial health, efficient capital utilization, and low solvency risk.

## Project 3 — Pricing & Revenue Forecasting
A demand and pricing analysis using consumer willingness-to-pay data. The model constructs a demand curve and estimates revenue and profitability across multiple price levels to identify the optimal pricing strategy.

**Key Concepts:**  
Revenue forecasting, contribution margin, demand elasticity, decision analysis.
### Pricing Strategy Conclusion

Consumer willingness-to-pay data was used to estimate demand at different price points and construct a demand curve. Revenue and profit were simulated across multiple pricing scenarios using contribution margin analysis.

The analysis showed that the revenue-maximizing price differs from the profit-maximizing price. Lower prices increased unit sales but reduced contribution margin, while higher prices improved margins but significantly reduced demand.

Profitability was most sensitive to price elasticity and purchase probability. The optimal pricing strategy is the price that maximizes profit rather than revenue, as maximizing revenue does not necessarily maximize shareholder value.

Recommendation: Adopt a price point that balances contribution margin and demand rather than targeting maximum sales volume.

## Project 4 — 3-Statement Financial Forecast Model
A fully linked financial model integrating the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The project evaluates how growth and working capital requirements affect liquidity and financing needs.

**Key Concepts:**  
Financial forecasting, working capital modeling, liquidity analysis, cash flow planning.
### Financial Forecast Interpretation

A fully integrated 3-statement financial model was developed linking the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement to project financial performance over a five-year period.

The analysis demonstrated that revenue growth increases profitability but also increases working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. As receivables and inventory grow, operating cash flow declines despite positive accounting earnings.

The model showed that a company can report rising profits while simultaneously experiencing liquidity pressure due to cash being tied up in operations and reinvestment.

Conclusion: Growth is not always self-financing, and sustainable expansion requires careful management of working capital and financing structure.

## Project 5 — Company Valuation (DCF) — Nestlé India
A discounted cash flow valuation estimating intrinsic firm value based on projected free cash flows and cost of capital. The analysis derives enterprise value, equity value, and an implied intrinsic share price.

**Key Concepts:**  
DCF valuation, WACC estimation, terminal value, intrinsic valuation.
### Valuation Conclusion

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using projected free cash flows and a weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The model estimated enterprise value, equity value, and intrinsic share price.

The valuation indicated that the majority of firm value is derived from long-term cash flow expectations and terminal value assumptions. Sensitivity analysis revealed that small changes in growth rate or discount rate significantly affect valuation.

This highlights that valuation is driven more by long-term operating performance assumptions than by short-term earnings.

The DCF framework provides a fundamental estimate of intrinsic value that can be compared with market price to assess overvaluation or undervaluation.

## Project 6 — Portfolio Risk & Return Analysis
A portfolio optimization analysis using Modern Portfolio Theory. The model calculates returns, volatility, correlations, and evaluates diversification benefits across multiple equities.

**Key Concepts:**  
Risk measurement, correlation, diversification, portfolio optimization.
### Portfolio Risk Analysis

Monthly returns of five large-cap equities were analyzed to calculate expected returns, volatility, and correlations. A diversified portfolio was constructed using Modern Portfolio Theory.

The analysis showed that portfolio risk depends not only on individual asset risk but also on correlations between securities. Combining assets with low correlation significantly reduced total portfolio volatility without proportionally reducing expected return.

The results demonstrate the diversification effect: an appropriately weighted portfolio can achieve a superior risk-return trade-off compared to investing in a single stock.

Conclusion: Asset allocation and diversification are key determinants of investment performance.

## Project 7 — M&A Accretion/Dilution Analysis
A merger model evaluating a hypothetical acquisition of Britannia Industries by ITC Ltd. The project analyzes transaction financing, pro forma earnings, and EPS accretion/dilution to assess shareholder impact.

**Key Concepts:**  
Merger modeling, transaction analysis, synergy evaluation, investment banking.
### Deal Recommendation

A merger model was developed to evaluate the acquisition of Britannia Industries by ITC Ltd. The analysis incorporated purchase premium, financing mix, interest expense, and operating synergies.

Post-merger earnings were calculated and compared to pre-merger earnings per share (EPS). The outcome depends heavily on financing structure and realized synergies.

The model demonstrates that an acquisition may increase total profits but still reduce shareholder value if additional shares issued or financing costs outweigh operating benefits.

Conclusion: The acquisition is financially attractive only if projected synergies are realized and financing costs are controlled.
